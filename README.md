This is a bot I'm making whichh can produce a youtube short from 0-100%. 

It uses a combination of AI to generate the script, then uses a voiceover to produce the video. 

The script is generated using GPT-3.5-turbo and the voiceover is generated using ElevenLabs. 

The images are sourced from Pexels and then blurred using a custom function. 

The video is then created using MoviePy. 

The video is then sped up using a custom function. 

The video is then saved to the output folder. 

I plan to upload this to a youtube channel and see how it goes. Also this is quite easy to scale among many other niches so I hope it's useful to anyone.
